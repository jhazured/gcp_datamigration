Suggestions for Improvement
README.md content:
Ensure your README explains:

How to set up environment variables (local vs Jenkins).

How to run tests and ETL jobs locally and in Docker.

Overview of folder structure and responsibilities.

Version control of secrets:

Confirm .env.* files with secrets are excluded from version control (.gitignore).

Provide a sample .env.example for developers.

Logging and error handling:

Ensure ETL scripts and framework handle errors gracefully and log meaningful messages.

Consider adding a centralized logging utility in utils.py.

Parameterize configs/ folder path:

Make the path to ETL YAMLs configurable in main.py or via environment variables for flexibility.

Testing coverage:

Add unit tests for all ETL components in tests/, including edge cases and failure modes.

Include integration tests that run full ETL jobs against mock data.

Documentation for notebooks/:

If notebooks are only for dev/debug, consider a README inside notebooks/ explaining their purpose and usage.

Task automation:

Consider adding a Makefile or invoke tasks for running common commands (pytest, building images, cleaning containers).

Dependency management:

If using multiple requirements files, consider pip-tools or poetry for easier management and lock files.

Docker optimizations:

Review Dockerfiles for caching best practices to speed up rebuilds.

Document how to extend or customize containers if needed.

Overall, your project structure and setup demonstrate solid engineering practices and a good foundation for scalable ETL development and deployment. With a bit more documentation, testing, and polish on environment/config management, youâ€™ll have a very robust system!
